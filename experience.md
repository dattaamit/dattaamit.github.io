## Internships

* Exact Private Aggregation with Fault Tolerance (June 2015 - August 2015)  
Mentors: [Nadia Fawaz](http://www.technicolor.com/en/nadia-fawaz) and [Marc Joye](http://www.technicolor.com/en/marc-joye),  
[Technicolor, Los Altos](http://www.technicolor.com/en/innovation/research-innovation/ri-laboratories/personalization-lab).  
I worked on improving the state-of-the-art techniques for private aggregation using cryptographic and information theoretic techniques. 

* Identifying flows in Big Data (June 2014 - August 2014)  
Mentor: [Saikat Guha](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/saikat/),  
[Microsoft Research, Bangalore](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/).  
I worked on identifying data-flows in big data applications from data-logs without using the scripts generating the logs. I used C\# and Scope to implement my techniques on Microsoft's big data platform - Cosmos.
     
* Oblivious RAM (May 2012 - August 2012)  
Mentors: [Michael Backes](http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~backes/) and [Aniket Kate](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~aniket/),  
[Max Planck Intitute for Software Systems, Saarbrücken](http://security.mpi-sws.org/).  
Oblivious RAM aims at allowing remote access to data without giving away even the access patterns of the data to the server. The objective of this work was to explore the various algorithms for O-RAM and try and improve the current known complexities.
     
* Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing with better complexity (May 2011 - July 2011)  
Mentors: [Michael Backes](http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~backes/) and [Aniket Kate](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~aniket/),  
[Max Planck Intitute for Software Systems, Saarbrücken](http://security.mpi-sws.org/).  
Devised a new AVSS protocol with a communication complexity of O(kn^2), improving the known best complexity of O(kn^3), where n is the number of parties participating in the secret sharing scheme and k is the security parameter.
     
* Online Assets Management Software (May 2009 - July 2009)   
Mentor: [Prakash Tripathi](),  
[Shriram Insight Share Brokers Ltd., Kolkata](http://www.shriraminsight.com/).  
Developed an online software for managing the assets of the firm.
