  <p>Amit received his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2018 with his thesis <i>Fairness and Privacy Violations in Black-Box Personalization Systems: Detection and Defenses</i>. Prior to that, he received his Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2012.</p>

  <p>Amit's expertise lies at the intersection of Privacy and Computer Science, where he translates foundational research into industry-scale engineering systems. His work focuses on architecting privacy-preserving solutions for major platforms that balance global regulatory requirements with business objectives and engineering constraints.</p>

  <p>Currently, Amit is a Senior Privacy Engineer at Amazon, where he leads cross-organizational initiatives to mitigate large-scale regulatory risks. Previously, he was on the Privacy Engineering team at Snap.</p>

  <p>Amit remains active in the professional community, serving on the Program Committee for the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr26" target="_blank">USENIX Conference on Privacy Engineering Practice and Respect (PEPR)</a> for 2025 and 2026.</p>

<!-- <p>Amit received his PhD from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in the <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> in 2018. He was advised by Professor <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/danupam/">Anupam Datta</a>.
Prior to that, he received his Bachelor of Technology from the <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> in 2012. </p>

<p>At a high level, Amit&#39;s research aims at improving privacy, fairness, and accountability in large-scale automated systems by drawing on techniques in experimentation, statistics, and machine learning. As part of his PhD research, he has developed methods to detect information flow in blackbox systems and applied them to find discrimination, opacity and choice on Google’s ad ecosystem. The information flow experiments framework (AdFisher) is open-sourced and freely available on <a href="https://github.com/tadatitam/info-flow-experiments">Github</a>. Details of the experiments and results are available <a href="http://fairlyaccountable.org/adfisher/">here</a>. He has also explored and evaluated privacy enhancing technologies and legal action as defenses against algorithmic discrimination. Here is a link to his <a href="https://kilthub.figshare.com/articles/Fairness_and_Privacy_Violations_in_Black-Box_Personalization_Systems_Detection_and_Defenses/6716627">disseration</a>. </p>
<p>Amit is now a Privacy Engineer at <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Snap Inc.</a> All further updates will be  at <a href="http://amitdatta.com" target="_blank">amitdatta.com.</a> </p> -->

<!--<p>As part of an ongoing project with Microsoft Research, he is evaluating Bing’s big-data advertising pipeline to detect discrimiantion, as well as describe how they came about in terms of inputs and intermediate outputs of the pipeline, thereby enabling accountability.</p>-->

<!--<p>He recently completed his <a href="/public/files/AmitDatta-Prospectus.pdf">thesis prospectus</a>.</p>-->
